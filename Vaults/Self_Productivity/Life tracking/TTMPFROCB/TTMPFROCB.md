## The Three Month Plan For Regaining Our Concentration Back
Yes, I’ve completed your plan! Here’s the breakdown:

### **Three-Month General Plan:**

#### **Month 1: Building the Foundation**
- **Target:** Achieve consistent daily study sessions of 4 Pomodoros (100 minutes total).
- **Focus:** Establishing a routine, increasing concentration, and eliminating distractions.
  
#### **Month 2: Increasing Study Time**
- **Target:** Increase daily study sessions to 8 Pomodoros (200 minutes total).
- **Focus:** Enhancing focus during sessions and gradually reducing break times.

#### **Month 3: Achieving the Goal**
- **Target:** Reach 12 Pomodoros (300 minutes total) with maximum concentration.
- **Focus:** Sustaining productivity, refining techniques, and solidifying habits.

### **Month 1: Detailed Plan**

#### **Week 1: Starting Slow**
- **Goal:** Complete 1 Pomodoro session daily (25 minutes).
- **Plan:**
  - **Day 1-3:** 1 Pomodoro per day. Focus on single tasks.
  - **Day 4-7:** 2 Pomodoros per day (separate by at least an hour).
  
- **Tips:**
  - Set a specific time each day for study sessions.
  - Eliminate distractions before starting (turn off notifications, choose a quiet space).
  - Use deep breathing or a quick walk to transition into study mode.

#### **Week 2: Building Consistency**
- **Goal:** Increase to 3 Pomodoros daily (75 minutes total).
- **Plan:**
  - **Day 1-3:** 2 Pomodoros back-to-back with a 5-minute break between.
  - **Day 4-7:** 3 Pomodoros with 5-minute breaks in between.
  
- **Tips:**
  - Begin your day with a review of tasks to stay organized.
  - Focus on completing tasks in each session, rather than perfecting them.
  - Use short breaks to refresh, not distract (e.g., stretch, drink water).

#### **Week 3: Strengthening Focus**
- **Goal:** Maintain 3 Pomodoros daily but improve focus.
- **Plan:**
  - **Day 1-3:** Continue with 3 Pomodoros; track your concentration level during each.
  - **Day 4-7:** Add an extra Pomodoro (4 total) if you feel ready.
  
- **Tips:**
  - Practice mindfulness during sessions to maintain concentration.
  - Avoid multitasking; focus entirely on one task at a time.
  - Reflect on what helped you stay focused and what distracted you.

#### **Week 4: Consolidating Gains**
- **Goal:** Consistently achieve 4 Pomodoros daily (100 minutes total).
- **Plan:**
  - **Day 1-3:** 4 Pomodoros with consistent break times.
  - **Day 4-7:** Review progress and adjust as needed.

- **Tips:**
  - Establish a pre-study routine to signal your brain that it's time to focus.
  - Set specific, achievable goals for each Pomodoro session.
  - End each day by reflecting on what went well and what you can improve.

### **General Tips Based on Research:**
- **Break Habits:** Slowly replace distracting habits with more productive ones. For instance, if you find yourself reaching for your phone during breaks, replace that with a quick stretch or a short walk.
  
- **Concentration Techniques:** 
  - **Mindfulness Meditation:** Practicing mindfulness for even 5 minutes a day can improve your ability to focus.
  - **Task Segmentation:** Break tasks into smaller, manageable pieces to maintain focus and avoid overwhelm.
  
- **Environment Optimization:** Make your study environment as conducive to focus as possible. Declutter your workspace, ensure good lighting, and minimize noise.

### **Weekly Check-ins:**
Every Friday, I’ll ask you:
1. How many Pomodoro sessions did you complete each day?
2. How would you rate your concentration during the sessions?
3. What were your biggest distractions or challenges?
4. Did you feel any progress compared to the previous week?

Based on your responses, I’ll adjust the plan for the following week.
