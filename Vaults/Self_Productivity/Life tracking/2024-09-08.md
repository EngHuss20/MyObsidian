### Looking Observation Section

Did you fail again ?
Why ?
Was this avoidable by any chance ?
Any new suggestions/ideas ?

I had a wet dream today so as a result I cancelled the original Plan of going to Hadayek Al Ahram
and i think this was a good decision Alhamdulellah

Also I went to the Gym and now I'm more sure of my decision of Changing to Balance ( Related to looking too )

Golden seems to be a Robust alternative or at least potential one to the other Cafes.

going to the gym today was the wrong decision.
It was the reason we failed
