# Day 6-1

___
### Looking Observation Section

Did you fail again ?
Why ?
Was this avoidable by any chance ?
Any new suggestions/ideas ?

At 2:14 I don't feel that i failed but the new girl here in coffee lab ..... i don't know how to say it
i guess I'm just attracted to how beautiful she is that i can't look away easily 
the good thing is that I'm not sexually attracted to her
So i will deal with that as a non-negative non-positive thing
I considered the day a successful one.

### Study log 

2:18 --> 1 pomodoro was achieved revising Quraan

Now What ?
I want to focus on making an efficient plan to get back on track with my courses using the spaced repetition flash cards during that

4:05 --> 4 consecutive pomodoros were achieved learning the basic syntax of C++ 
Note : we stopped at Episode 14 Elzero C++ course

Now after taking one good break in which i cleared my mind watching the road enjoying the good weather while drinking  a strong double espresso, I think i can continue making this day a very productive one.
Lets go for some reading and studying IoT.
