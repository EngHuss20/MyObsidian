### Looking Observation Section

Did you fail again ?
Why ?
Was this avoidable by any chance ?
Any new suggestions/ideas or any thing you want to leave here ?

Yes

During the swimming session there was a girl and I failed not to look.
Also I noticed it was harder in general to stop looking today than before.
I want to mention the rule of the ring road advertisements too.

I think they were actually avoidable to a certain extent 
For example i could stop going to the swimming sessions for the next month then it would be much easier due to the time.
but for the ring road i don't think it was actually avoidable by any chance.
maybe i could stay at home and not go out for while but i really don't think this is a good ,effective or productive idea due too the current situation

I think we should continue Observing this and try to find more details and notice the small things and events related to having difficulty or not in looking.
