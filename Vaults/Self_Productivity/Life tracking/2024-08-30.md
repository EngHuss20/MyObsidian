___
### Looking Observation Section

Did you fail again ?
Why ?
Was this avoidable by any chance ?
Any new suggestions/ideas ?

We actually did it today
I think it was simply due to lack of interaction 
also i need to say that i didn't go to the gym, drive on ring road, walk a lot in the street or go to a cafe to study.

In general it was an off day but not a destructive one and that is what matters really.
