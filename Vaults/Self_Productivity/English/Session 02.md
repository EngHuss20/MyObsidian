#### Introduction

This episode talks about the ownership of the sky. First, we need a definition for the word sky. In most languages it means what is between land and space. The complexity in this topic lies within deciding where does the sky start and end, as there is no clear line that separate the sky and the space or between the sky and the lands either. 

#### Atmosphere 

The atmosphere starts at the ground and goes up to 250 miles. these 250 miles are divided to sections. The most important one of them is the troposphere, where most of the action happens.

#### Ownership of the sky

In this section we will talk first about individual level. The old rules (before airplanes) sayed that anyone owns a land owns also the sky that is above his land. This rule which was made in the 13th century had to have some amendments. After amendments, the rule says that a land owner owns the immediate airspace above his land. Immediate here is defined as the space required so others can't interfere with the routine use of it. This airspace goes up around 100 hundred meters from the building. The above section of the sky is simply owned by the country below it. The country that own the airspace can decide to not allow usage of their airspace. Also this space is considered a territory for the country and it can extract tariffs. The airspace above that is not really accessible for us as humans. So, until now there are no fast and hard rules for them until now.
