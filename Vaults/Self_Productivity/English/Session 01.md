### Main points

###### $Introduction$

>This episodes main topic is the ownership of the Lands, Sea & Space. So Alister starts by explaining that lands are simply owned by countries each country has its own international borders which determine the area of influence and authority of the country.

###### $Oceans$

>In this section Alister says that the oceans are great resources nowadays for every country, resources for valuable things like oil and gas , food and also resources for money . Above all of that oceans have a great importance geopolitically ,so basically all the countries want to increase their portion they got of the ocean if possible. Then Alister divided the the oceans into two main categories : coastal water and high seas.

###### $Coastal$

>The water close to the coast of the country is called coastal water.
###### $HighSeas$

>The water further than 3 miles from the coast of the country. The 3 miles number was decided due to historical reasons. As in the past this was the minimum distance that the canons could hit the ships from, so if a ship of another country get too close from the coast of another country that the canons of the other country could reach it that would be trespassing on the water of the other country and it has the right to attack the ship. That was called the canon shot rule. Outside the range of 3 miles is considered international water and not a specific country's territory. The nature of water made it difficult to ___demarcate___ <Set the boundaries or limits> 

After that he started to demonstrate how the UN made a three broad categories of sea that is owned to a certain extent by a country. Firstly 12 nautical miles from the coast -->the waters belonging to the country were the coast is located has the write to do anything with there water. Secondly up to 200 nautical miles from the coast the country has the rights to the waters resources oil, gas, fish and so on. Thirdly for countries with a wide continental shelf these economic rights extend up to 350 nautical miles from the coast.
