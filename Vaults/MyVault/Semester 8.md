The last semester had a lot of good things like :
- Zad
- The first trial to memorize Quran
- My best GPA in the most difficult semester
- Wa3y
- Engineer Ayman Abdel Raheem
- Eh El Moshkelah
- My relationship with both my parents got much better and also with my brothers

After all of that this Semester started with some big challenges :
- Continue with Zad but better 
- Get back to track on memorizing Quran 
- Try to save your Gpa
- Filter the people around you 
- Clean your Environment
- **Ramadan**
- Understand your fight and find your place in it
- Embedded linux course during the semester
- Al Tawba

And i was doing really bad, and when i was losing and understood that i couldn't do anything by myself, ***Everything*** changed.

I can't describe what happened properly with my language and for sure i can't in English, but i can say that : everything simply changed.

And I'm actually writing this now to remind myself what happened.

Now the semester has just few weeks including exams, Now the fight to take everything from this semester starts : 
- [[Semester 8 Final Exams]]
- Save [[Embedded Linux]] course
- Hold yourself with all you have got --> [[Quran]]
- [[ASP_Project]]
