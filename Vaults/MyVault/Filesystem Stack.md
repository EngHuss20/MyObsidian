why filesystem ?
- the filesystem is the component in the system that manages the files somehow
- vghjk

user space --> Directories and files
sd card --> binary
for the user space to retrieve the files somehow from the storage device it must convert the data on the storage device to other type of data

user space -->(hello world)
--> storage device

! there are different types of files and diff types of filesystems 

virtual filesystem came to solve the problem as it is a generic way to use any filesystem with the kernel and even changing the filesystem during the run time

virtual filesystem --> mapping 
tells the kernel which filesystem does the s device have

!! mounting point

mount & unmount 
Add     & remove     filesystem

operations on directories
- create 
- rename
- open
- list content
- copy --
- move
- rename
- permissions

very important command
--> file <-->
